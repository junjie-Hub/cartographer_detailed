  --Cartographer accumulates num_accumulated_range_data frames into one large frame as the input of the algorithm.
  --Cartographer believes that each frame is independent. It compensates for the distortion of the lidar data 
  --caused by motion in units of frames, and then gathers these frames together.
  --Therefore, the higher the frequency of the data frame received by Cartographer, the better the compensation
  -- effect of Cartographer and the higher the quality of the input data of the algorithm.
